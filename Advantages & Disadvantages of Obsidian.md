# Why I use obsidian?
Obsidian main feature is ***==links==*** and ***==backlinks==*** through notes and *** ==visualizing those links==*** via a ==Knowledge Graph== so if you have a bunch of notes where you mention the word chemistry they will all be linked in the graph itself, it ends up being a **web of knowledge**.

- Non-linear file management.
- Ideas and relationships visualized.
- akin to a second brain
- Lots of plugin options to extend functionality
- Easy to customize (practice your css)

# Downside 👎🏻
On the other hand The biggest disadvantages of Obsidian would be the limitations of Markdown.

Tables, for example... and various colored and sized fonts. There are ways to do this, but it won't be as straightforward as doing stuff in any other format.

- It's offline, lack of native collaboration. ( actually , you can use Github )
